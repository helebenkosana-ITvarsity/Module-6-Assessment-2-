                <p>Ready to drive your dream car?</p>

                <p>AutoTrader uses state-of-the-art technology to bring motor vehicle buyers and sellers together. In addition, it was the first in its category in South Africa to launch a fully responsive website. World class iOS and Android applications mean car shoppers can car shop anywhere, anytime. With over 70% of South African dealerships advertised on Auto4Sale, finding the right vehicle is easy with the assurance of variety and choice.</p>
                <p>Thousands of private advertisers have sold their vehicles on Auto4Sale. And with a focus on solving for pain points in the car buying journey, in 2018 AutoTrader introduced a managed process called "We Sell"- for people seeking a hassle-free car sale process. Autot4Sale has created tools for sellers to track online performance. And as the market leader, AutoTrader leveraged the large amounts of data in possession to create AutoFuzion - revolutionary software designed to use up to the minute demand and supply trends to help dealers make better pricing and stocking decisions. Vehicle Check was another example of AutoTraderâ€™s commitment to transparency in the car buying process and allows car shoppers to check a cars history before buying. While in partnership with Qhubekha, AutoTrader created #DriveChange, An initiative which helps hundreds of underprivileged children get bicycles to get to school everyday.</p>
